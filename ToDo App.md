\
This To-Do app utilizes Firebase services for user authentication, remote configuration, and data storage. The app is designed to provide a seamless experience for managing tasks while leveraging the power of Firebase for real-time functionality and dynamic updates.\
\
## Features\
\
### Firebase Authentication\
This app uses **Firebase Authentication** to handle user sign-up and login. Users can create an account using their email and password. The authentication flow is managed using FirebaseAuth, providing a secure way to authenticate users and manage their sessions.\
\
- **Sign Up**: Users can register with an email and password.\
- **Login**: Users can log in to their accounts using their credentials.\
\
### Firebase Remote Config\
**Firebase Remote Config** is utilized to manage and customize app settings remotely. This feature allows for dynamic changes to UI elements without requiring an app update.\
\
- **Dynamic Updates**: Fetches values from the Firebase console, enabling real-time updates to UI components.\
\
### Firebase Firestore\
The app utilizes **Firebase Firestore** to store and retrieve To-Do items associated with each user. Firestore provides a flexible, scalable database solution, enabling real-time synchronization and easy data access.\
\
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks in their To-Do list.\
- **Real-time Updates**: The app automatically updates the task list as items are added or removed.\
